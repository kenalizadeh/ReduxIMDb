struct AppContainerView: View {
    // For data that should be shared with many views in your app, SwiftUI gives us the @EnvironmentObject property wrapper. This lets us share model data anywhere itâ€™s needed, while also ensuring that our views automatically stay updated when that data changes.
    // Think of @EnvironmentObject as a smarter, simpler way of using @ObservedObject on lots of views. Rather than creating some data in view A, then passing it to view B, then view C, then view D before finally using it, you can create it in view A and put it into the environment so that views B, C, and D will automatically have access to it
